You will be taken to the Paint editor, where the new backdrop will be highlighted in the list. If you have other backdrops in your project, you will also see them in the list.

To set the main colour of the backdrop, click on the **Rectangle** tool, then use the **Fill** colour chooser to select a colour, then drag the shape over the full backdrop canvas:

If you want to add more details to your backdrop, you can use the **Rectangle** tool, **Circle** tool, or **Brush** tool, or a combination of all three!

When you have finished, make sure that you give your new backdrop a sensible name:

Your new backdrop will be shown on the Stage and will be available to use in `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks.
